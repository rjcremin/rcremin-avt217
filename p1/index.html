    <h1>The Muses</h1>
    <h2>an exceprt from Stephen Fry's <i>Mythos</i>.</h2>
  <body>
    <p>One of the original Titans, Mnemisyne (Memory), was mother by Zeus to nine highly intelligent and creative daughters, the Muses, who lives at various times on Mount Helicon (where the Hippocrene fountain later played), on Mount Parnassus above Delphi, and in Pieria in Thessaly where the Pierian Spring, the metaphorical sources of all the arts and sciences flowed.</p>
    <p>We think of the <a href="erato/index.html" class="erato">Muses</a> today as patron saint of the arts in general, and private sources of inspiration in particular. “O for a <a href="euterpe/index.html" class="euterpe">Muse</a> of fire!” cries the Chorus at the opening of Shakespeare’s Henry V. He or she is “my <a href="clio/index.html" class="clio">muse</a>” we might say of those who fire our creativity and spur us on to greatness.</p>
    <p>The <a href="calliope/index.html" class="calliope">Muse</a>s can be found in “<a href="melpomene/index.html" class="melpomene">muse</a>ic,” “a<a href="thalia/index.html" class="thalia">muse</a>ments,” “<a href="terpsichore/index.html" class="terpsichore">muse</a>ums,” and general "<a href="polyhymnia/index.html"class="polyhymnia">muse</a>ings.” W.H. Auden believed the image of a capricious goddess whispering ideas in the poet’s ear was the best way of accounting for the maddening unreliability of creative inspiration. Sometimes she gives you gold, sometimes you read back what she has dictated and see that it is dross. The <a href="urania/index.html" class="urania">Muses</a>’ mother might be Memory, but their father is Zeus, whose faithless inconstancy is the subject of many stories yet to come.</p>
    <p>But let us meet these nine sisters, each of whom represent and stands patron to their own particular art form.</p>
