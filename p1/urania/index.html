    <h1>Urania</h1>
  <body>
    <p>Urania derives her name from Ouranos, the primal god of the heavens (and a great-grandfather of the nine sisters); she is the Muse who presides over astronomy and the stars. She is also considered a figure of Universal Love, a kind of Greek version of the Paraclete, of Holy Spirit.</p>
