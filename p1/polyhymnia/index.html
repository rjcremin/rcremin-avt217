    <h1>Polyphemnia</h1>
    <p>Hymnos is the Greek for “Praise”, and Ployphemnia was the Muse of hymns, of sacred music, dance, poetry, and rhetoric as well as-slightly randomly one might think-agriculture, pantomime, geometry, and meditation. I suppose today we would call her “the Muse of <a href="../urania/index.html">mindfulness</a>.” She is usually portrayed as a rather serious figure, finger held pensively to her mouth in an attitude of solemn rumination. She is another contender, along with Calliope, for mother of the hero Orpheus. </p>
