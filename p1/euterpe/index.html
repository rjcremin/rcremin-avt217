    <h1>Euterpe</h1>
  <body>
    <p>The Muse of music itself, the “delightful” and “joyous” Euterpe bore, by the river god Strymon, the Thracian king Rhesus who went on to play a very minor part in the <a href="../clio/index.html">Trojan War</a>. Whether he gave his name to the monkeys that in turn went on to describe types of human blood factor is not agreed upon.</p>
