    <h1>Calliope</h1>
  <body>
    <p>Rather an undignified linguistic end meets calliope, the Muse of epic poetry. Somehow, she became a steam-powered organ commonly played in fairgrounds, which are just about the only places where you will hear her name spoken today. To the Roman poet Ovid she was the chief of all the Muses. Her name means “beautiful voice,” and she gave birth to Orpheus, the most important musician in all Greek history. The finest poets, Homer, Virgil, and Dante included, invoked her aid when embarking on their great epics.</p>
