    <h1>Melpomene</h1>
    <p>The tragic Muse, Melpomene (whose name derives from a Greek verb meaning “to celebrate with dance and song”), represented originally the chorus and then the whole of tragedy-a very important fusing of music, poetry, drama, mask, dance, song, and religious celebration. Tragic actors wore a type of thick-soled boot, called a “buskin” in English and the cothurnus in Greek; and Melpomene is usually depicted either holding or waring these, as well as, of course, the famous tragic mask with its unhappy down-curved lips. Along with her sister Terpsichore, she was a mother to the sirens, whose time will come.</p>
